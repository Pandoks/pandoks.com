  # NOTE: if you want to change the ports, look into dual service cutover for zero downtime
  # we want to let the helm chart manage the service so we don't have to worry about updates
  # only when we're changing the ports (which should be once in a blue moon) will we then manually
  # manage the service so that we can do the dual service cutover, but then we'll change it back
