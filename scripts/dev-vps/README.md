# OVH VPS-4 development host

After the SST state cleanup in this runbook, SST does not purchase or manage
this VPS. Purchase or reinstall VPS-4 with Ubuntu 24.04 in the OVH Control
Panel.

## Initial console setup

Open the OVH KVM/web console. Do not enable or use public SSH.

```sh
apt-get update
apt-get install -y curl
install_script="$(mktemp)"
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh -o "${install_script}"
sh "${install_script}"
rm -f "${install_script}"
tailscale up \
  --ssh \
  --hostname=pandoks-dev-box \
  --accept-dns=false \
  --advertise-tags=tag:ovh,tag:dev
```

Open the printed Tailscale login URL and approve the device. Keep the OVH
console open.

## Prepare over Tailscale

From another terminal, prove that the private path works:

```sh
tailscale ssh root@pandoks-dev-box
```

Clone this repository using your normal GitHub authentication, then run:

```sh
cd pandoks.com
sudo scripts/dev-vps/setup.sh prepare
exit
tailscale ssh pandoks@pandoks-dev-box
cd pandoks.com
sudo scripts/dev-vps/setup.sh verify-tailscale
sudo scripts/dev-vps/setup.sh lockdown
sudo scripts/dev-vps/setup.sh status
pnpm bootstrap all
```

Do not close the original OVH console until the second
`tailscale ssh pandoks@pandoks-dev-box` succeeds after lockdown.

## Verify the public interface

From a machine outside the tailnet:

```sh
printf "VPS public IP from OVH Control Panel: "
read -r VPS_PUBLIC_IP
nc -vz -w 5 "${VPS_PUBLIC_IP}" 22
```

The connection must fail. Never save the entered address as an application
secret.

## SST state cleanup

The checked-in helper is the only authorized cleanup procedure:

```sh
scripts/dev-vps/cleanup-state.sh
```

It privately exports state through the repository's local SST binary, accepts
exactly one historical family (Hetzner or OVH), rejects duplicates, mixed state,
and cross-provider types, and never prints an ID or registration key. It asks
for physical identifiers with terminal echo disabled, verifies them before any
state removal, makes the operator explicitly distinguish a retained manual
service from an already-deleted stale resource, handles only an exact key-only
orphan without a primary record after the operator types `orphan-remove`, and
rejects a final diff mentioning any of the four historical resource names. Do
not run ad-hoc `sst state remove` commands.

## Recovery

If Tailscale fails before lockdown, continue in the still-open OVH console.

If access fails after lockdown, use the OVH KVM console or rescue environment:

```sh
nft flush ruleset
systemctl restart tailscaled
tailscale status
```

Repair Tailscale, prove `tailscale ssh pandoks@pandoks-dev-box`, then rerun:

```sh
cd pandoks.com
sudo scripts/dev-vps/setup.sh verify-tailscale
sudo scripts/dev-vps/setup.sh lockdown
```
