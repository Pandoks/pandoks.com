# Pandoks üêº

All things that are related to Pandoks runs on this monorepo. Over time, some of these will branch
off into their own repos, but for now, they are all here.

# Getting Started

Look at [.env.example](/.env.example) and create `.env.<stage>` files. During _development_, you'll
want to use the `.env.<dev-stage>` file where `<dev-stage>` is your local machine's username.
[`sst`](https://sst.dev/) will automatically use the `.env.<dev-stage>` file if you don't specify a
`--stage` flag. During _production_, you'll want to use the `.env.production` file. You'll also have
to specify a `--stage production` flag.

Once you have created your `.env` files, run this from the root of the monorepo to set it up for
development:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run sso
pnpm sst install
```

> [!NOTE] AWS SSO only verifies you for 12 hours, so you'll have to run `pnpm run sso` again once in
> a while

## Local Kubernetes Cluster

Although not all of the apps are deployed to Kubernetes, majority of the services are running in a
cluster. To make development easier, we can use a local Kubernetes cluster ([k3d](https://k3d.io/))
to run a copy of the production cluster. This makes it so that majority of the times, we can work
offline or test certain features without having to deploy to a full fledged Kubernetes cluster in
the cloud. _Because we're using k3d, which puts an entire Kubernetes cluster inside of docker
containers, not everything is one to one with the production cluster. ie. networking, registries,
etc_

To setup the local cluster, run this from the root of the monorepo:

```sh
pnpm run setup
pnpm run cluster:secrets # assuming that you are still verified via SSO
pnpm run cluster:build
pnpm run cluster:push
pnpm run cluster:deploy
```
